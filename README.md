>_.lib file is a collection of logical modules which includes all basic logic gates. It may also contain different flavors of the same gate (2 input AND, 3 input AND â€“
slow, medium and fast version)._

#### Faster cells and Slower Cells

A cell delay in the digital logic circuit depends on the load of the circuit which here is Capacitance.

Faster the charging / discharging of the capacitance --> Lesser is the Cell Delay

Inorder to charge/discharge the capacitance faster, we use wider transistors that can source more current. This will help us reduce the cell delay but at the same 
time, wider transistors consumer more power and area. Similarly, using narrower transistors help in reduced area and power but the circuit will have a higher cell 
delay. Hence, we have to compromise on area and power if we are to design a circuit with low cell delay.

#### Constraints

A Constraint is a guidance file given to a synthesizer inorder to enable an optimum implementation of the logic circuit by selecting the appropriate flavour of cells 
(fast or slow).

# Basics of STA

### 2.1. Introduction to STA

Static timing analysis (STA) is a method of validating the timing performance of a design by checking all possible paths for timing violations. STA breaks a design 
down into timing paths, calculates the signal propagation delay along each path, and checks for violations of timing constraints inside the design and at the 
input/output interface.

# Advanced Constraints

**Clock**
A digital clock is a repeating digital waveform used to step a digital circuit through a sequence of states. A clock signal oscillates between a high and a low state 
and is used like a metronome to coordinate actions of digital circuits. A clock signal is produced by a clock generator. Digital circuits rely on clock signals to know when and how to execute 
the functions that are programmed. If the clock in a design is like the heart of an animal, then clock signals are the heartbeats that keep the system in motion.
In serial communication of digital data, clock recovery is the process of extracting timing information from a serial data stream to allow the receiving circuit to decode 
the transmitted symbols. This is one method of performing a process commonly known as clock and data recovery.

![advanced constraints - intro - 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83152452/179352587-e98ae362-31c2-448f-99ea-259a98162e8e.png)

### 3.1. Clock Tree Modelling - Uncertainty

Clock uncertainty is the difference between the arrivals of clocks at registers in one clock domain or between domains. it can be classified as static and dynamic 
clock uncertainties. Pre-layout and Post-layout Uncertainty. Pre CTS uncertainty is clock skew, clock Jitter and margin. After CTS skew is calculated from the actual 
propagated value of the clock.

Static clock uncertainty: it does not vary or varies very slowly with time. Process variation induced clock uncertainty. An example of this is clock skew.

Timing Uncertainty of clock period is set by the command set_clock_uncertainty at the synthesis stage to reserve some part of the clock period for uncertain factors 
(like skew, jitter, OCV, CROSS TALK, MARGIN or any other pessimism) which will occur in PNR stage. The uncertainty can be used to model various factors that can 
reduce the clock period. It can define for both setup and hold.

Skew: This phenomenon in synchronous circuits. The Difference in arrival of clock at two consecutive pins of a sequential element.

max insertion delay: delay of the clock signal takes to propagate to the farthest leaf cell in the design.

min insertion delay: delay of the clock signal takes to propagate to the nearest leaf cell in the design.

Latency: The delay difference from the clock generation point to the clock endpoints.

Source latency: Source latency is also called insertion delay. The delay from the clock source to the clock definition points. Source latency could represent either on-chip or off-chip latency.

Network latency: The delay from the clock definition points (create_clock) to the flip-flop clock pins.

Jitter: Jitter is the short term variations of a signal with respect to its ideal position in time. It is the variation of the clock period from edge to edge.it can vary +/- jitter value. From cycle to cycle the period and duty cycle can change slightly due to the clock generation circuitry. This can be modeled by adding uncertainty regions around the rising and falling edge of the clock waveform.

Sources of jitter:

Internal circuitry of the PLL.
Thermal noise in crystal oscillators.
Transmitters and receivers of resonating devices.

Creates a generated clock in the current design at a declared source by defining its frequency with respect to the frequency at the reference pin. 
The static timing analysis tool uses this information to compute and propagate its waveform across the clock network to the clock pins of all sequential elements 
driven by this source. 

The generated clock information is also used to compute the slacks in the specified clock domain that drive optimization tools such as place-and-route.

# Optimizations

### 4.1 Combinational  Optimizations

The Combinational optimization phase transforms the logic-level description of the combinational logic to a gate-level netlist.

Combinational optimization includes:

- Technology-Independent Optimization: This optimization operates at the logic level. Design Compiler represents the gates as a set of Boolean logic equations.
- Mapping: During this process, Design Compiler selects components from the logic library to implement the logic structure.
- Technology-Specific Optimization: This optimization operates at the gate level.

### 4.2 Sequential  Optimizations
  
Sequential optimization includes the initial optimization phase, which maps sequential cells to cells in the library, and the final optimization phase, where Design 
Compiler optimizes timing-critical sequential cells (cells on the critical path):

- Initial Sequential Optimization
- Final Sequential Optimization

### 4.3 Boundary Optimization
  
Boundary optimization results fastest critical paths and smallest design.

Basically four optimizations collectively called as Boundary optimization in synthesis (with respect to DC):

a) Inversion pushing across hierarchy.
b) propagation of equal and opposite information
c) propagation of unconnected /undriven ports.
d) propagation of constants..

```
$ set_boundary_optimization u_im false
```

### 4.4 Register Retiming

Register retiming is a circuit optimization technique that moves registers forward or backward across combinational elements in a circuit. The aim of this procedure is
to shorten the clock cycle or reduce circuit area. There are two basic types of register retiming: Forward retiming and backward retiming.

### 4.6 Multicycle Paths

A Multi-Cycle Path (MCP) is a flop-to-flop path, where the combinational logic delay in between the flops is permissible to take more than one clock cycle. Sometimes 
timing paths with large delays are designed such that they are permitted multiple cycles to propagate from source to destination.
 
```
$set_multicycle_path -setup 2 -to prod_reg[*]/D -from [all_inputs]

$set_multicycle_path -hold 1 -to prod_reg[*]/D -from [all_inputs]
```

# Quality Checks

To start the Physical design these are the files we get input from Synthesis:
- Netlist
- SDC

After receiving database from synthesis team and prior to place and route you can perform some sanity checks. To validate the quality of constraints read in the 
netlist and the sdc file in the primetime and perform check_timing and generate report which will giving inputs like the quality of database like:

how many of the flip flops are getting clocks, how many flops are constrained, how many ports are having constrained or whether there is any violation like that which 
will surely give some idea about the quality of the delivered database.

In order to understand the quality of the database interms of timing , generate timing reports and understand the quality of timing how good or how bad is the database
and how much you can optimize at the backend or at the placement and routing stages or what paths you cannot meet timing even during placement stages.

After analysing bit on the timing reports you can get some idea of what all areas you need to close pack during placement so that you can create regions.

Generate report_area and report_references -hier report in the designcompiler or synthesis stage to better understand the design hierarchy.


### 5.1 Report timing

The Report Timing command allows you to specify options for reporting the timing on any path or clock domain in the design.

In a hold timing report, the tool is checking whether the data is held long enough after the clock arrival at the clock port of the flop. i.e. if the data path is 
faster, the data at the flop edge can change earlier than the stipulated hold time.

Timing path is defined as the path between start point and end point where start point and end point is defined as follows: Start Point: All input ports or clock pins 
of a sequential element are considered as valid start point. End Point: All output port or D pin of sequential element is considered as End point.

The main goal of static timing analysis is to verify that despite these possible variations, all signals will arrive neither too early nor too late, and hence proper 
circuit operation can be assured. Since STA is capable of verifying every path, it can detect other problems like glitches, slow paths and clock skew.

### 5.2 Check_timing, Check_design, Set_max_capacitance, HFN

**check_timing:** Checks the assertions and structure of the design for potential   timing violations.This   command is used to identify possible problems before generating timing or constraint reports. This command also prints which checks it performs. If a check reveals a violation,   the   command   also prints a message about the violation. By default, the message contains a summary of the violation. To   get   more information about violations, use the -verbose option.

**Check_design:** check_design checks the current design for consistency. The check_design command checks the internal representation of the current design for consistency, and issues error and warning messages as appropriate. 

**Set_max_capacitance:** Specifies a maximum capacitance on pins, ports or design. If maximum capacitance is set on a pin or port, the net connected to that pin 
or port is expected to have a total capacitance less than the specified capacitance_value. If specified on a design, the default maximum capacitance for that design is
set. Library cell pins also can have max_capacitance value specified.

**HFN:** High Fanout Net Synthesis (HFNS) is the process of buffering the High Fanout Nets to balance the load.
